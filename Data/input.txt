Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field that helps computers understand and work with human language. It is used in many areas like chatbots, search engines, translation, sentiment analysis, and voice assistants. NLP combines computer science, linguistics, and AI to make machines interact with people naturally. It also faces challenges like understanding context, as some words have different meanings depending on usage. Machine learning and deep learning have improved NLP a lot, making tasks like text classification and information retrieval easier. As NLP grows, issues like bias, privacy, and responsible use are becoming more important.
